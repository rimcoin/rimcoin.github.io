<h1>Rimcoin</h1>

<p>Rimcoin is a decentralized P2P currency by the Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/iHateRa1n">@iHateRa1n</a>. </p>
<p>You have likely heard of Bitcoin, but how is Rimcoin different from Bitcoin? </p>

<h1>Differences</h1>

<p>&#8226; Bitcoin has a capped supply of 21,000,000 coins. However, Rimcoin has no cap of coins. </p>
<p>&#8226; To have a capped supply of 21,000,000 coins, Bitcoin has a halving block reward every 840,000 blocks. Rimcoin however, will always have a 50 coin reward for finding a new hash. </p>
<p>&#8226; Bitcoin uses cryptography to verify transactions. Rimcoin does not. HOWEVER: Rimcoin has multiple nodes (just like any other decentralized currency). But when you create a wallet, THAT NODE manages that wallet. They are not the only party who stores your balance, but when you send Rimcoin, that node will notify ALL other nodes. Nodes then verify if that transaction is actually coming from the CORRECT IP ADDRESS. If so, they modify the balance file. </p>
<p>&#8226; Bitcoin is programmed in C++. Rimcoin is programmed in Python. </p>
<p>&#8226; Bitcoin (and almost all other cryptocurrencies) operate with a blockchain. Rimcoin only stores the final balances, to save space. </p>
<p>&#8226; Bitcoin has 10 minute transactions. Rimcoin has almost instant transactions. </p>

<h1>Wallets</h1>

<p>Wallets, like in other cryptocurrencies, are where Rimcoin is stored. </p>
<p>In Rimcoin, wallets are just any string. In Bitcoin, wallets are the public key for digital signatures. </p>

<h1>Possible coins</h1>

<p>As mentioned in the "differences" section, Bitcoin has a capped supply of 21,000,000 coins. </p>
<p>Rimcoin does not have any cap. </p>

<h1>Mining</h1>

<p>As mentioned in the "differences" section, Rimcoin does not operate on a blockchain. </p>
<p>So mining is not supporting any type of blockchain. </p>
<p>Instead, mining is simply generating a hexadecimal int, hashing it with SHA256, and getting it to be below a certain number. (the difficulty)</p>
<p>When a new hash is found, the miner who found it is rewarded 50 coins. </p>

<h1>Author</h1>

<p>Rimcoin was created by the Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/iHateRa1n">@iHateRa1n</a>, as mentioned in the first section. </p>
<p>He is now a part of the development team, who's Twitter is <a href="https://twitter.com/rimcoinProject">@rimcoinProject</a>. </p>

<h1>License</h1>

<p>Rimcoin is licensed under a custom license, designed by the original creator, <a href="https://twitter.com/iHateRa1n">@iHateRa1n</a>, known as the Credit License. 
<p>It says you simply must credit the creator, Rimcoin Project, for Rimcoin; and not blame it for any issues. </p>

<h1>Decentralization</h1>

<p>Rimcoin is decentralized by utilizing nodes. Nodes work by utilizing an HTTP server, with certain commands. </p>
<p>None of them are listed here, because there are LOTS. </p>
